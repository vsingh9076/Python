##Linked List

A basic linked list consists of nodes where each node contains two fields: a data field to store the element, and a reference (or link) field to point to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list typically has a reference field pointing to null, indicating the end of the list.

Node 1         Node 2         Node 3
+------+       +------+       +------+
| Data |  ---> | Data |  ---> | Data |
+------+       +------+       +------+
| Next |       | Next |       | Next | --> null
+------|       +------+       +------+
